# AMPLITUDE MODULATION
## Theory
In this set of experiments we are going to perform Double Side Band Suppressed Carrier and Large Carrier modulations on arbitrary signals. 

In large carrier signals we use envelope detection to recover the message signal. On the other hand we use synchronous demodulation in suppressed carrier.
